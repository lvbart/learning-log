# 191210: practial data cleaning  
## data cleaning project  
1. Inspect the data  

2. Regex to the rescue  

# 191211: sample report page design  
### Two parts:  ET and ROI  
first design the ROI page  

# 191212: Recursion  
### Recursion: concept  
* a strategy for solving problems by defining the problem in terms of itself.  
* In programming, recursion means a function definition will include an invocation of the function within its own body.   
Recursion has two fundamental aspects: the base case and the recursive step.  

### ROI page design  

# 191213: Recursion  
* stack: A data structure typically abstracted away from us which stores function calls in program.  
### recursion in Python  
### Sample report page design  
* smooth scroll  
* navbar  
* three parts  
* Nginx  
* sidebar? maybe next time  
## build up framework for the site  

# 191214ï¼štailwind  
follow youtube course, after install and set bg, had to learn by myself on offcial website.  
* utility first  
* responsive design  


# 191215: fan site about Jackson  
use the newly required skill on tailindcss  

# 191216: recursions again  
write the first ever recursion, wired  

# 191217: recursion again  
Recursion and Big O  

# 191218: open another course  
* can't continue on recursion, failed again!  
* so open another course about data analysis with Pandas  
more relevent to my work  
### abstract the book: data thinking  
I've sold the book and it will gone on Saturday, but I found it's worthy to read...  
so make notes of this book before I lose it. 

# 191219: CSV  
* read csv  
`pd.read_csv("csv_name")`  
* save to csv  
`df.to_csv("csv_you_want_to_save")`  

# 191220: data analysis with Pandas  
* select one column  
`df['column_name']`  
* select multiple columns  
`df[['column_name', 'another_column_name']]`  
*select rows  
`df.iloc['row_index']`  
`df.iloc[3:7]` would select all rows starting at the 3rd row and up to but not including the 7th row  


# 191223: data analysis with Pandas  
* select single column  
`df[df.column_name]`  
* select multiple columns  
`df[(df.column_1_name) | (df.column_2_name)]`  

# 191225: data analysis with Python  
select rows form df  
`df[df.name.isin(["name_1','name_2'])]`  
### setting indices  
`df.reset_index(drop=True)`  

# 191226: data analysis Pandas  
add new column  
`df['new_column'] = ['item_1', 'item_2']`

# 191227: data analysis Pandas  
* modifying data frame  
add new column option 2  
`df['new_column'] = 'Value'`  
add new column option 3  
`df['Margin'] = df['Revenue]' - df['Cost]`  
apply  
`df['Lowercase Name'] = df.Name.apply(lower)`  
## Lambda function  
* A lambda function is a way of defining a function in a single line of code.   
`mylambda = lambda x: x[0] + x[-1]`  
print(mylambda('This is a string'))  
* if function  
`lambda x: [OUTCOME IF TRUE] if [CONDITIONAL] else [OUTCOME IF FALSE]`  
```  
mylambda = lambda x: 'Welcome to BattleCity!' \
	if x >= 13 \
  else 'You must be over 13'  
```  
# 191230: data analysis with Pandas  
* lambda and split  
```  
get_last_name = lambda x: x.split()[-1]
df['last_name'] = df.name.apply(get_last_name)  
```
