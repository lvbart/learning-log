### 191010:learn statistics with Python  
* the mean:  
np.average(array)  
* the median:  
a common measure of a dataset’s center.  

### 191011:learn statistics with Python  
* the mode:  
The most frequently occurring observation in the dataset. A dataset can have multiple modes if there is more than one value with the same maximum frequency.  
`  
stats.mode()  
`
### 191012:learn variance  
* variance:  
descriptive statistic that describes how spread out the points in a data set are.

- for part4-**change to report page**  
- for part5-budget console:add progress bar  
- for part6-G2:add intro part of G2  

### 191014:learn variance  
* When calculating variance, we don’t care if a data point was above or below the mean — all we care about is how far away it was. To get rid of those pesky negative numbers, we’ll square the difference between each data point and the mean.  
```  
teacher_one_variance = np.var(teacher_one_grades)  
```  
* Variance is useful because it is a measure of spread.   
* srandard deviation
