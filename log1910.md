### 191010:learn statistics with Python  
* the mean:  
np.average(array)  
* the median:  
a common measure of a dataset’s center.  

### 191011:learn statistics with Python  
* the mode:  
The most frequently occurring observation in the dataset. A dataset can have multiple modes if there is more than one value with the same maximum frequency.  
`  
stats.mode()  
`
### 191012:learn variance  
* variance:  
descriptive statistic that describes how spread out the points in a data set are.  

### 191013:improve showcase websites  
* try to add new feature-search office code  
due to the limitiation of fetch API ***CORS*** issue, failed  
** new features**  
* add the static review - pdf version, just in case  
* put intro elements inside each card body  
- for part1-book info: add a picture  
- for part2-book review: add span and h3  
- for part3-flash reort: add input button  
- for part4-**change to report page**  
- for part5-budget console:add progress bar  
- for part6-G2:add intro part of G2  

### 191014:learn variance  
* When calculating variance, we don’t care if a data point was above or below the mean — all we care about is how far away it was. To get rid of those pesky negative numbers, we’ll square the difference between each data point and the mean.  
```  
teacher_one_variance = np.var(teacher_one_grades)  
```  
* Variance is useful because it is a measure of spread.   
* srandard deviation

### 191015:learn statistics  
* Standard deviation is computed by taking the square root of the variance.  
```  
std()  
```  
### 191016:statistics project  
1. explore the data  
#### print some rows  
```  
print(london_data.head())  
print(london_data.iloc[100:200])   
```  
#### print how many  
`print(len(london_data))`  
#### get a single column from data  
`print(londpn_data["column name"])`  

2. looking at temp  
3. filtering by month  
`print(london_data.loc[london_data["month"] == 7]["TemperatureC"])`  
* Looking at the spread of the data is an important statistic to consider if you are particularly sensitive to extreme days. For example, if you pick a month with a large standard deviation, you might have one day that is relatively cold while the following day is very hot.  
### 191017:histograms  
"the power of statistics is more often used to communicate that certainty doesn’t really exist. Instead, it provides tools to communicate how uncertain we are about a problem."  
* bins and counts  
`np.histogram(array, range = (20, 50), bins = 3)`  
* range includes everything from 20, up until but not including 50  

### 191018:plotting a histogram  
```
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt  
plt.hist(data, range=(0, 24), bins=4)  
plt.show()  
```
