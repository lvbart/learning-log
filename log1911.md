* showcase website redesign  


# plans for recent:

* the automatical analysis  

## 191101: binding data  

## 191104: D3 and showcase pages

in #dashboard  

## 191105: D3 and showcase pages  
* D3: 
#### enter() and append（）  
```  
divSelection
  .data(videoData)
  .enter()
  .append("div")
  .text(function(d) { 
     return d.title + ": " + d.amount + " views";
	 })
  .attr("class", "bar")
  .style("width", function(d) { return 50 * d.amount + "px"; });  
  ```  
#### Interactivity with events  
  `on()`  
```  
  .on('click', function(i, d) => {
    d3.select(this).text(d);
  });
```  
* Selections are array-like data structures that include a reference to the elements with D3 methods and their hierarchy in the DOM. You can create a selection with .selectAll() or a single-item selection with .select()  
* The .data(), .enter() and .append() methods all work in unison to create elements and associate their corresponding data with the existing DOM  
* The d parameter inside functions used in a D3 context represents the datum associated with the element at hand  
* The .attr() and .style() methods allow you to customize the appearance of each element based on data.  
* The .on() method can bind an event listener on the elements in the selection.  

### 191106: D3 and showcase pages  
### a project on the D3 learning  

### learn how to pick up type of chart  
* comparison: among items / over time  
* composition: change over time / static  
* relationship: two variables / three variables  
* distribution: one / two / three or more variables  

3 steps on data visualization: preparing / visualizing / styling  

### openpyxl  
`import openpyxl`  
#### getting sheet from workbook  
`wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('name.xlsx')`  
#### getting cell from sheet  
`sheet.cell(row=2, column=2).value`  
#### getting rows and columns from sheet  

### D3 liquid fill gauge  
a vivid chart on how much was spend, perfect for the % of budget  
but fail...  
can't load, don't know why, I copy the html code from D3, and find the js file by searching.   

### 191107: data types and add sth to teamwang.rocks  
* primitives: numbers / strings / booleans  
* choose what framework? Vue?  
no, just make simple website first  

#### create account on Azure: lvnan.airchina@gmail.com  
but fail to register, bc they need visa/master card, come back tomorrow  
for try VS code online  

### 191108: functions and control flow  
* A function is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit.  
* We use a function by *calling* it, and can be use many times, makes it reusable  
* functions can have parameters, which accept input values, making its instructions flexible  

* control flow  
*conditional*: if sth, then do X, otherwise do Y;  
*loop*: do sth Z times;  
*exception*: do A, B, C, if sth wrong, jump to step X, Y, Z
