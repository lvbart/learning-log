# learning log for Nov-2019  
main focus:  
* the data visualization:D3  
* showcase website redesign  


# plans for recent:  
* teamwang.rocks: website build  
* the automatical analysis  

## 191101: binding data  

## 191104: D3 and showcase pages  
* D3: attr() and style()
* report sample: add new page for HQ,
in #dashboard  

## 191105: D3 and showcase pages  
* D3: 
#### enter() and append（）  
```  
divSelection
  .data(videoData)
  .enter()
  .append("div")
  .text(function(d) { 
     return d.title + ": " + d.amount + " views";
	 })
  .attr("class", "bar")
  .style("width", function(d) { return 50 * d.amount + "px"; });  
  ```  
#### Interactivity with events  
  `on()`  
```  
  .on('click', function(i, d) => {
    d3.select(this).text(d);
  });
```  
* Selections are array-like data structures that include a reference to the elements with D3 methods and their hierarchy in the DOM. You can create a selection with .selectAll() or a single-item selection with .select()  
* The .data(), .enter() and .append() methods all work in unison to create elements and associate their corresponding data with the existing DOM  
* The d parameter inside functions used in a D3 context represents the datum associated with the element at hand  
* The .attr() and .style() methods allow you to customize the appearance of each element based on data.  
* The .on() method can bind an event listener on the elements in the selection.  

### 191106: D3 and showcase pages  
### a project on the D3 learning  

### learn how to pick up type of chart  
* comparison: among items / over time  
* composition: change over time / static  
* relationship: two variables / three variables  
* distribution: one / two / three or more variables  

3 steps on data visualization: preparing / visualizing / styling  

### openpyxl  
`import openpyxl`  
#### getting sheet from workbook  
`wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('name.xlsx')`  
#### getting cell from sheet  
`sheet.cell(row=2, column=2).value`  
#### getting rows and columns from sheet  

### D3 liquid fill gauge  
a vivid chart on how much was spend, perfect for the % of budget  
but fail...  
can't load, don't know why, I copy the html code from D3, and find the js file by searching.   

### 191107: data types and add sth to teamwang.rocks  
* primitives: numbers / strings / booleans  
* choose what framework? Vue?  
no, just make simple website first  

#### create account on Azure: lvnan.airchina@gmail.com  
but fail to register, bc they need visa/master card, come back tomorrow  
for try VS code online  

### 191108: functions and control flow  
* A function is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit.  
* We use a function by *calling* it, and can be use many times, makes it reusable  
* functions can have parameters, which accept input values, making its instructions flexible  

* control flow  
*conditional*: if sth, then do X, otherwise do Y;  
*loop*: do sth Z times;  
*exception*: do A, B, C, if sth wrong, jump to step X, Y, Z  
#### create Azure account and set up VS online  
add some extensions  

update the showcase page  
- update the sample report: for GM and accountant  
- update links accordingly  

### 191111: API and JSON  
#### reopen my repos about reports and translation  
* goal: extract useful description to form a report  
* how to: collect small pieces of those reports and sort them into JSON files  
* next: learn how to use it with API  
* dissect 3 reports into small pieces  

#### learn coding basic:  
* list: a data structure  
access data: access an item in a list by using its index position    
add data: append / splice  
remove data: pop / splice  

### 191112: Loop  
wildly used bc they save time, reduce error and easy to read  
* for(count-controlled): repeated run several times, know how many times should be run, *iteration;  
* while(condition-controlled): repeated run, know when to stop. *warning: infinite loop*;   
* for each(collection-controlled): use when you need to perform a task for every item in a list, or when the order of things must be maintained.  

### 191113: data cleaning  
Regular Experssion *regex*
#### use pipeline (vertical bar) for OR  
*no space!!!*  
#### Character sets, denoted by a pair of brackets []  
match any   
carrot ^ symbol: Placed at the front of a character set, the ^ negates the set, matching any character that is not stated.   
#### wildcard: .  
.....: matches 5 digits  
....\.: matches any four digits but not five  
#### ranges  
[0-9]  
[a-b]  
[A-B]  
[A-Za-z]   
*within any character set [] we only match one character.*  
#### shorthands  
\w: matches a single uppercase character, lowercase character, digit or underscore, same as [A-Zz-z0-9_]    
\d: matches a single digit, same as [0-9]  
\s: matches a single space, same as [ \t\r\n\f\v]  
\W: the “non-word character”  
\D: the “non-digit character”   
\S: the “non-whitespace character”    

#### grouping:()  
I love (you|your cat)  

#### quantifiers:{}  
DWA\w{3}Y!  
Quantifiers - Optional: ?  
? only applies to the character directly before it.  
when you want to use ? in your text, it's \?  


### 191115: regex again!!  
#### Kleene star *: matches the proceding character 0 or more times  
#### Kleene plus +: matches the proceding character 1 or more times  

#### anchors: ^ and $  

#### Regex summary:  
##### alternation: |  
##### character set: []  
##### wildcard: .  
##### ranges: []  
##### shorthand sets:  \d \s \w and \W \S \D  
##### grouping: ()  
##### fixed quantifiers: {}  
##### optional quantifiers: ?  
##### Kleene quantifiers: * and +  
##### anchors: ^ and $  

### 191118: true data cleaning  
steps about data cleaning:  
* diagnosing the “tidiness” of the data — how much data cleaning we will have to do  
* reshaping the data — getting right rows and columns for effective analysis  
* combining multiple files  
* changing the types of values — how we fix a column where numerical values are stored as strings, for example  
* dropping or filling missing values - how we deal with data that is incomplete or missing  
* manipulating strings to represent the data better  

#### tidy data  
* each variable as a separate column  
* each row as a separate observation  
some useful functions:  
.head() — display the first 5 rows of the table  
.info() — display a summary of the table  
.describe() — display the summary statistics of the table  
.columns — display the column names of the table  
.value_counts() — display the distinct values for a column  

#### collect data in a more human way-Typeform  
* set up the basic logic flow  
* set up the
