## need to build up the fan page  
* first version has been done, have few problems:  
1. pintures need to be resized to fit for the screen  
2. too much details, cover the pretty face  

## learn on cloud computing  
Cloud computing is renting resources, like storage space or CPU cycles, on another company's computers.  
The computing typically include:  

Compute power - such as Linux servers or web applications  
Storage - such as files and databases  
Networking - such as secure connections between the cloud provider and your company  
Analytics - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data  
  
* Compute power: virtual machine/Containers/Serverless computing  
* Storage: Cloud providers typically offer services that can handle all of these types of data.   
* Benefits of cloud computing
