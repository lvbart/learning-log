# 200103: CSS and cloud computing  
## need to build up the fan page  
* first version has been done, have few problems:  
1. pintures need to be resized to fit for the screen  
2. too much details, cover the pretty face  

## learn on cloud computing  
Cloud computing is renting resources, like storage space or CPU cycles, on another company's computers.  
The computing typically include:  

Compute power - such as Linux servers or web applications  
Storage - such as files and databases  
Networking - such as secure connections between the cloud provider and your company  
Analytics - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data  
  
* Compute power: virtual machine/Containers/Serverless computing  
* Storage: Cloud providers typically offer services that can handle all of these types of data.   
* Benefits of cloud computing  

# 200106: Vue  
To learn Vue, need some catch up in basic HTML and JS  

# 200107: Vue and cloud computing:  
## Vue makes front-end web development faster to write, easier to read, and less error-prone.    
* el: indicate which element you want to manipulate  
* To display dynamic information we need:  
A place to store the data we will be displaying  
A syntax for displaying that information  
* Templates contain all of the hard-coded information displayed on the site but specify places where dynamic information needs to be filled in.  



## cloud computing  
### there are 3 types:public/private/hybrid     
Cloud computing is flexible and gives you the ability to choose how you want to deploy it. The cloud deployment model you choose depends on your budget, and on your security, scalability, and maintenance needs.  
 
### 3 tyeps of cloud services  
* Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)  

* Platform as a service (PaaS)  

* Software as a service (SaaS)  
  
 # 201008: Vue: directives  
 * Directives: make complex front-end code easy to write, easy to read, and optimized for great site performance.  
 * Components:  custom, reusable HTML elements  
 * pieces of dynamic information, called props,   
 * virtual DOM  
 
# 200109 Vue  
* data: displaying and updating dynamic data for users is essential functionality for most front-ends.  
Most values on the web can change at any moment, such as the number of likes on a post or the current set of posts to display. We call constantly-changing data values like this dynamic data.   

# 200110: Vue   
Vue allows us to store data that can be calculated using values from the data object at a separate property called computed.  
* get and set  

# 200113: Vue data  
* watch  
* instance method  
storing dynamic data based on other dynamic data should not be stored in data  

# 200114: Vue form  
v-model: binding data
