# 200103: CSS and cloud computing  
## need to build up the fan page  
* first version has been done, have few problems:  
1. pintures need to be resized to fit for the screen  
2. too much details, cover the pretty face  

## learn on cloud computing  
Cloud computing is renting resources, like storage space or CPU cycles, on another company's computers.  
The computing typically include:  

Compute power - such as Linux servers or web applications  
Storage - such as files and databases  
Networking - such as secure connections between the cloud provider and your company  
Analytics - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data  
  
* Compute power: virtual machine/Containers/Serverless computing  
* Storage: Cloud providers typically offer services that can handle all of these types of data.   
* Benefits of cloud computing  

# 200106: Vue  
To learn Vue, need some catch up in basic HTML and JS  

# 200107: Vue and cloud computing:  
## Vue makes front-end web development faster to write, easier to read, and less error-prone.    
* el: indicate which element you want to manipulate  
* To display dynamic information we need:  
A place to store the data we will be displaying  
A syntax for displaying that information  
* Templates contain all of the hard-coded information displayed on the site but specify places where dynamic information needs to be filled in.  



## cloud computing  
### there are 3 types:public/private/hybrid     
Cloud computing is flexible and gives you the ability to choose how you want to deploy it. The cloud deployment model you choose depends on your budget, and on your security, scalability, and maintenance needs.  
 
### 3 tyeps of cloud services  
* Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)  

* Platform as a service (PaaS)  

* Software as a service (SaaS)  
  
 # 201008: Vue: directives  
 * Directives: make complex front-end code easy to write, easy to read, and optimized for great site performance.  
 * Components:  custom, reusable HTML elements  
 * pieces of dynamic information, called props,   
 * virtual DOM  
 
# 200109 Vue  
* data: displaying and updating dynamic data for users is essential functionality for most front-ends.  
Most values on the web can change at any moment, such as the number of likes on a post or the current set of posts to display. We call constantly-changing data values like this dynamic data.   

# 200110: Vue   
Vue allows us to store data that can be calculated using values from the data object at a separate property called computed.  
* get and set  

# 200113: Vue data  
* watch  
* instance method  
storing dynamic data based on other dynamic data should not be stored in data  

# 200114: Vue form  
v-model: binding data  
that automatically binds form fields to dynamic values on the Vue app. When a form field is bound to a value, whenever the value in that form field changes, the value on the Vue app will change to the same value as well. Similarly, if the data on the Vue app changes, the value in the form field will automatically change to reflect the new value to the user.  

# 200117: Vue- Radio button binding  
* Radio buttons are a series of buttons where the user can only select one. When a different button is selected, the previously-selected button becomes unselected.  
* Array Checkbox Bindings: the dynamic piece of data bound to these types of checkboxes must be an array. This array stores all of the values checked in the list of checkboxes  

200119: Auzre learning  
* what is scale?  
Scale refers to adding network bandwidth, memory, storage, or compute power to achieve better performance.  
Scaling up, or vertical scaling means to increase the memory, storage, or compute power on an existing virtual machine. For example, you can add additional memory to a web or database server to make it run faster.  
Scaling out, or horizontal scaling means to add extra virtual machines to power your application. For example, you might create many virtual machines configured in exactly the same way and use a load balancer to distribute work across them.  

# 200120: Vue  
* Boolean checkbox binding  
* Form event handler  
forms have two built-in events that we need to handle:   
submit events (when a submit button is pressed to submit the final form) and   
reset events when a reset button is pressed to reset the form to its initial state  
`v-on:`  
`@`  

# 200121: Vue  
* prevent: this will prevent the page from reloading.  
* event modifiers  
* input modifiers  
1. `.number`  
2. `.trim`  
3. `.lazy`  
× form validation  
We use the v-bind directive to set the value of the disabled property on a “Submit” button to the value of a computed property called formIsValid  
formIsValid will contain some logic that checks the values stored on the Vue app and returns a boolean representing whether or not the form is valid  
If the form is valid, formIsValid will return true and the disabled property will not be present on the “Submit” button, keeping the button enabled  
If the form is not valid, formIsValid will return false and the button will be disabled
